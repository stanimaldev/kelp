Below is a list of some potential features to ADD to Ravenous:

!TO-DO:
# if businesses list is empty / no results: 
# https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search
+ Error message if there's no results to display "food in bosnia, or north korea, seoul doesn't work??" or any other weird base cases, or empty searches
+ Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again
- Why do I have to click the 'sort by options' TWICE for it to requery???? -- NOW IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK ANYMORE??
- set a warning flag to appear after initial successful search click that timesout that says "double click on any "sort by" option to change results!"
- check CS50M note about 'immutability' DIDN'T WORK. ...spread operating a new array every time, but it seems like it's a fault on yelp. 


- set auto default location - ask user first to allow their location - navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition -- not quite sure to implement this.. (also functional components?)
- start converting class components to functional. start with BusinessList.js, make a copy first.

- Implement your own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location) - will need yelp API term for closest or nearest, and make a drop down options menu for 5 mi, 10 mi, 15 mi?


- Add autocompletion of addresses to the “Location” input <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places"> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete  var autocomplete = new google.maps.places.Autocomplete(input); -- sign up for api key?

Different kinds of Google API's. API Picker: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/api-picker 
Google Cloud Platform to enable or disable API's: https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started - https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#enable-api-sdk tutorials on it
Using the Places API!
LIFESAVER video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5LhLZqj76s (initMap is not a function error: because the script needs to look at the 'window' level. so at window.document.body.. etc. window.initMap = this.initMap) https://www.elharony.com/initmap-is-not-a-function/ 
"For Development Purposes Only" greyed out watermarks on map if I don't enable Billing... -- Check YELP API if they have a MAP VIEW???


Animations/CSS:
- page intro animation, cascade opacity fade and slide things into place smoothly, animation delays so it's all orchestrated
+ loading animation when you click or enter "Let's Go" search - how to get rid of "loading..." once results have rendered? https://scrimba.com/p/p7P5Hd/c4kJNSL try a this.state = isLoading: bool toggle
- Search results fade-in appear fluidly animation - setTimeout each individual one so it cascade loads? ALSO scale animate them up and down too, bubbly/bouncy

- Beautify Map toggle button
- check everything mobile and desktop

- change name to belch or something like yelp, something congruent to local search app
- change background image banner
- for mobile, remove :hover animations

!DONE:
+ instead of linking to google maps address, bring in the yelp business "url" property and link it to go to yelp website about it
+ Check YELP API if they have a MAP VIEW!
+ Add an entire "Map View" button click toggle.
+ Google Maps API - with pointers of search results - NEED TO SET UP BILLING
+ Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab
+ Make images clickable and have them open the business’ website in a new tab
+ Allow you to search by pressing “Enter” (or “Return”) on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking
+ how to make error message disappear, timer? or once initiating a new search
+ hover animation over individual search result squares
